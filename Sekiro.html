  <p><h3>Hello this is a guide on how to play Sekiro and I will be telling tips and tricks and important things you dont want to miss.</h3></p>
  
  <h2>Beggining of the game</h2>
  <p><h3>To start off the one thing you want to try to learn right away is to parry. Parrying attacks is very important skill learn</h3></p>

<p><h3>Next will be  the healing Gourd, these make it so you can heal youself at anytime even underwater and you increase your amount by finding gourd seeds</h3></p>
<p><h3>and then by giving them to Emma</h3></p>
<p><h3>Now you will get shinobi tools that will help you throughout the game you will use some more than others</h3></p>
<h2>Shinobi Tools<h2>
