  <h1>Guide on how to play Sekiro</h1>
  <p><h3>Hello this is a guide on how to play Sekiro and I will be telling tips and tricks and important things you dont want to miss.</h3></p>
  
  <h2>Beggining of the game</h2>
  <p><h3>To start off the one thing you want to try to learn right away is to parry. Parrying attacks is very important skill learn</h3></p>
<p><h3>because by parrying attacks of the enemy your posture will never break</h3></p>
<p><h3>Then you will want to get skills and you can unlock them by a gaining skill points by killing enemies and bosses and they will be very important for bosses later in the game</h3></p>
<p><h3>You can unlock more skills by finding arts like Ashina arts and Temple arts</p></h3>
<p><h3>The most important skill in the game in the Mikiri Counter which you will use very often</h3></p>
<p><h3>Next will be  the healing Gourd, these make it so you can heal youself at anytime even underwater and you increase your amount by finding gourd seeds</h3></p>
<p><h3>and then by giving them to Emma</h3></p>
<p><h3>Now you will get shinobi tools that will help you throughout the game you will use some more than others</h3></p>
<h2>Shinobi Tools<h2>
  <ul>
    <li><h3>Loaded Shuriken</h3></li>
    <li><h3>Firecrackers</h3></li>
    <li><h3>Flame Vent</h3></li>
    <li><h3>Loaded Axe</h3></li>
    <li><h3>Mist Raven Feathers</h3></li>

    <li><h3>Loaded Umbrella</h3></li>
    <li><h3>Divine Ubduction</h3></li>
    <li><h3>Finder Wistle</h3></li>
  </ul>
  <p><h3>Most of these tools you will want to use and upgrade but some like the Divine Abduction and Sabimaru you probably won't use</h3></p>

  <h2>Mini Bosses and Bosses</h2>
  <p><h3>Mini bosses are important in the game because they drop Prayer beads that will increase you health and posture</h3<p>
  <p><h3>but you cannot get the maximum amount of health and posture by just killing the mini bosses you have to find some prayer beads</h3></p>
  <p><h3>around the map</h3></p>
  <p><h3>and also some of the mini bosses like Shishimen Warriors will drop Shinobi tool upgrade materials but need divine confette to kill</h3></p>

  <p><h3>Killing all the bosses mkaes it so you can increase your attck power but some bosses are optional but if you want to maximise your attack power</h3></p>
